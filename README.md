# Task Factory  

## Summary  
Midnight hack to prep my calendar for a year of Github commits. I can tolerate manually creating a few copies of tasks, but 365 times? Let's face it, this is much more fun. 

It started as a task factory - create a task a day for X number of days in a row. Turns out I can more easily manage my tasks by building this tool.
