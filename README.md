# Task Factory  

## Summary  
Midnight hack to prep my calendar for a year of Github commits. I can tolerate manually creating a few copies of tasks, but 365 times? Let's face it, this is much more fun. 

Authenticate with your Google account. Click a button, sit back, and watch tasks show up.

## // TODO  
* Date picker  
* Task customization  
* Pretty UI (It looks so boring right now!)
